- Idea for this page: Have a grid of avatars and images. Should
have a folder of image or image links where we open the urls
and get the images. With each image we should have a button
with text "select". If user presses the button, then we 
change the style of the button to be noticeably different with 
text "Current". This would update the avatar in the database.
